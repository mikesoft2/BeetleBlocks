# Beetle Blocks
Visual programming blocks for 3D-printable design

Beetle Blocks is a visual, blocks-based programming environment for
3D design and fabrication. BeetleBlocks programs move a graphical
"beetle" around a 3D world, where it can place 3D shapes, extrude 
its path as a tube, and generate geometry in other ways. The
resulting 3D geometry can be exported as a 3D-printable file.

Beetle Blocks is a project by [Eric Rosenbaum](http://ericrosenbaum.com), [Duks Koschitz](https://architecture.mit.edu/alumni/duks-koschitz), 
and [Bernat Romagosa](http://bromagosa.github.io), with additional software development by [Jens Mönig](http://github.com/jmoenig).

Beetle Blocks is based on [Snap<i>!</i> Build Your Own Blocks](http://snap.berkeley.edu), a visual, blocks based programming language
inspired by [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu) written by Jens Mönig (jens@moenig.org) and Brian Harvey (bh@cs.berkeley.edu).

#Third party packages

Beetle Blocks uses [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org) as its 3D rendering engine.
For constructive solid geometry, it uses the [ThreeCSG](https://github.com/chandlerprall/ThreeCSG) plugin.
File operations are powered by [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/).

If you find we're using a package that is not listed here, please let us know, it was an unintentional slip! :)
